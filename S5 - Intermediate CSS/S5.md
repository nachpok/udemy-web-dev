CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

**favert icon:**
creat favicon (icon by the page title) at [favicon.cc](https://www.favicon.cc/)
place in html page head:

```
<link rel="icon" href="./favicon.ico" />
```

**margin**
lots of html elements have default margin values that are set by the browser, to override them we need to specify are own default values.

**box moudle**
every html element is a box, this box has a _border_ taht surroundes it, a _margin_ that pushes away other box's around it, and _padding_ that pushes the box border away from elements in the box.

**div**
div's are box's thate contains html tags, but without any visible manifestation. the div's allow us to style elements as a group.

**block vs inline elemnts**
some elements like <p> <div> and more are block's, that means that by default they span the full width of the screen. other elements are inline, such as <img> <span> and there for there width is only the width of the element itself.
you cand change the display property of ether to inline/ block. there is a middle option of 'inline-block' that is inline but allows ajusting the width and the height.

in order to hide an element you can set it to {display:none;} , witch will remove it from the screen. or, you cant set it to {visibility:hidden;}, that will hide the content of the element but it will still take up space on the screen.

**relative position**
the default of an element is to stick to the top left corner of its container, aside from playing with the margin we can ajust its position. for example  
element{
position:relative
left:30px
}
will push the element 30px way from its left defult location, so 30px to the right. the diffrence form adding a margin, is that a margin expands the elements space on the grid, while position keeps its original location regarding the effect on the surrounding elements, all that changes is the appearance of this specific element on the screen.

**absolute position**
not like relative positioning that keeps it original space on the page, absolute positioning moves the actual element relative to the top left of the parent element.
so it will look like this
element {
position: absolute;
left: 200px;
}

**fixed position**
fixed position is not effected from the scrooling of the page, it is relative to the screen window, not the page.

**center elements**
the basic way to center an element is with "text-align:center", when there is a width that will not work, so what you can use is "magin:auto" that auto generates right and left margins taht center an element.

**fonts**
there are two main font familys, Serif and Sans-serif. sans-serif are the simple one's, and serif are the one's with add tips at the end of the letters arms. if we choose to add a fancey font make shure that it uses a backup funt in case the browser cant import the fancey one.
element{
font-family: serif/sans-serif/ect',backup-font;
}
[font safty list](https://www.cssfontstack.com) gives the % of the fonts by OS and a list of fall backs that mach that font.

the develper can add there own font to the web settings and avoid the borwser not having it pre-downloded.
[google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/?subset=vietnamese&preview.text=ubuntu&preview.text_type=custom) supplys <link> tags that contine a full set of the fonts.

the default size of fonts are 16px (can be changed), in order to keep the relative diffrences in the page it mite be better to diffine font-size in presents and not in a fixed size. the easy way is using "em's", 'em' is the width of a 'm', so to {font-size:500%} === {font-size:5em}.
the issoue with 'em' and % is that it is relative, so if the body is '2em' and the p is '2em' then it will add up to '4em'. to deal with this we have 'rem' witch is 'root em' that referos to the root element and dose not add up.

**floting**
positioning and element relative to anoter elemten, so if an <img> and <p> share a <div> and we set the <img> to flot to the left then the <p> will be to its right and not beneath it.
we can escap the floating by using {clear:left}, so if we have on <p> that we wat to wrap the <img> and one we want to sit beneath we will clear it.
