**Typography**
different fonts cause different effects, a serf font can give more of an authority feel, while a san-serf is easier to read and feels more friendlier.

**Attention hierarchy**
we don't go from top to bottom, rather follow size, shapes, colors and fonts. so we can help the users focus on the important info first, and then if they choose so to move of to the minor details.

- the effective width of a column of text is 50-60 characters
- alignment effects the association of one group of text with another
- whitespace gives a feel of impotence
- Audience - who are you trying to attract?
