**z index**
elements stack themselves based on the order in the html page, from bottom to top.
the default z index of every element on an HTML page is 0, we can chang specific elements index. in order for this to work we need to define a position (for example 'absolute', {position:static} is the same as no position):

```
.class{
    position: relative;
    z-index: num;
}
```

**Media Query breakpoints**
in the css file we can specify what happens to when we are viewing from a screen the size of X and a different set of rules for when the width is Y. Or we can set specific css settings for speech mode or if the user prints the page.
this is set in the css file in the format of:

```
@media (condition){
    condition specific css rules
}
```

a condition that apples to windows up from a width of 900px (and up) to a width of 1000px (and down) is:

```
@media (min-width: 900px) and (max-width: 1000px){...}
```

**refactor code**
Guiding principles for code refactoring:

1. Readability
2. Modularity
3. Efficiency
4. Length

go over code and look for code that repeats itself and write functions/ css class selectors that will address all of those cases.

**Combining CSS selectors**
selector1, selector2{
applies to both selectors
}

#id.class{
applies to an element with the combination of the #id and the .class
}

#id .class{
applies to a element with the class of .class inside an element with the id of #id
}

**Selector priority**
the later selector has priority over the earlier one, and the specific selector has priority over the general one.
